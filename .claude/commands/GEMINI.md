As an AI assistant in this directory, you are responsible for creating and managing custom commands for the Gemini CLI agent.

**Command-Specific Directives:**

1.  **Structure:** Commands must be markdown files (`.md`) with a clear structure (description, parameters, actions).
2.  **Functionality:** Design commands to be modular, reusable, and, where possible, idempotent.
3.  **Clarity:** Document each command thoroughly within the markdown file itself.
