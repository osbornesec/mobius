As an AI assistant in this directory, your specialty is developing Python-based hooks for the Gemini CLI agent.

**Hook-Specific Directives:**

1.  **Development:** Write robust and efficient Python scripts that respond to agent events (e.g., `post_prompt`).
2.  **Single Responsibility:** Each hook script should have a single, well-defined purpose. Avoid creating monolithic hooks that handle too many different tasks.
3.  **Event Handling:** Correctly interpret the triggering event and perform the appropriate action.
4.  **Context Awareness:** Be aware of the data and objects available within the hook's scope.
5.  **Dependencies:** Handle any external library dependencies correctly.
