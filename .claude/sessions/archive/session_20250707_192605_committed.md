### [2025-07-07 19:23:19] Task

**Input:** {"description":"Investigate dependencies and vulnerabilities","prompt":"I need to investigate the current dependencies and vulnerability sources in this repository. According to GitHub, there are 9 vulnerabilities (2 critical, 2 high, 3 moderate, 2 low).\n\nPlease help me:\n1. Find all dependency files in the repository (package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, etc.)\n2. Read their contents to understand what dependencies are currently installed\n3. Look for any existing security-related files or vulnerability reports\n4. Check if there are any lock files that might pin specific versions\n5. Search for any .github/dependabot.yml configuration\n\nFocus on identifying the source of these vulnerabilities so we can plan how to fix them."}

[{"number":9,"state":"open","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"sentry-sdk"},"manifest_path":"requirements.txt","scope":"runtime","relationship":"unknown"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-g92j-qhmh-64v2","cve_id":"CVE-2024-40647","summary":"Sentry's Python SDK unintentionally exposes environment variables to subprocesses","description":"### Impact\n\nThe bug in Sentry's Python SDK <2.8.0 results in the unintentional exposure of environment variables to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting.\n\n### Details\n\nIn Python's `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls, like in this example:\n\n```\n>>> subprocess.check_output([\"env\"], env={\"TEST\":\"1\"})\nb'TEST=1\\n'\n```\n\nIf you'd want to not pass any variables, you can set an empty dict:\n\n```\n>>> subprocess.check_output([\"env\"], env={})\nb''\n```\n\nHowever, the bug in Sentry SDK <2.8.0 causes **all environment variables** to be passed to the subprocesses when `env={}` is set, unless the Sentry SDK's [Stdlib](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations/#stdlib) integration is disabled. The Stdlib integration is enabled by default.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/3251 and the fix released in [sentry-sdk==2.8.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/2.8.0). The fix was also backported to [sentry-sdk==1.45.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.45.1).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if it's not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, there are two options:\n\n1. In your application, replace `env={}` with the minimal dict `env={\"EMPTY_ENV\":\"1\"}` or similar.\n\nOR\n\n2. Disable Stdlib integration:\n```\nimport sentry_sdk\n\n# Should go before sentry_sdk.init\nsentry_sdk.integrations._DEFAULT_INTEGRATIONS.remove(\"sentry_sdk.integrations.stdlib.StdlibIntegration\")\n\nsentry_sdk.init(...)\n```\n\n### References\n* Sentry docs: [Default integrations](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations/)\n* Python docs: [subprocess module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html)\n* Patch https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/3251","severity":"low","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-g92j-qhmh-64v2","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2024-40647","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/security/advisories/GHSA-g92j-qhmh-64v2"},{"url":"https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/3251"},{"url":"https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/commit/763e40aa4cb57ecced467f48f78f335c87e9bdff"},{"url":"https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html"},{"url":"https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations"},{"url":"https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations/#stdlib"},{"url":"https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/2.8.0"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40647"},{"url":"https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.45.1"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g92j-qhmh-64v2"}],"published_at":"2024-07-18T17:18:46Z","updated_at":"2025-06-06T22:27:44Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"sentry-sdk"},"severity":"low","vulnerable_version_range":">= 2.0.0a1, < 2.8.0","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.8.0"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"sentry-sdk"},"severity":"low","vulnerable_version_range":"< 1.45.1","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"1.45.1"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","score":2.5},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N","score":1.8}},"epss":{"percentage":0.00045,"percentile":0.13481},"cvss":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","score":2.5},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-200","name":"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"sentry-sdk"},"severity":"low","vulnerable_version_range":"< 1.45.1","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"1.45.1"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/osbornesec/mobius/dependabot/alerts/9","html_url":"https://github.com/osbornesec/mobius/security/dependabot/9","created_at":"2025-07-08T00:16:39Z","updated_at":"2025-07-08T00:16:39Z","dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":null,"auto_dismissed_at":null},{"number":8,"state":"open","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"python-jose"},"manifest_path":"requirements.txt","scope":"runtime","relationship":"unknown"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-6c5p-j8vq-pqhj","cve_id":"CVE-2024-33663","summary":"python-jose algorithm confusion with OpenSSH ECDSA keys","description":"python-jose through 3.3.0 has algorithm confusion with OpenSSH ECDSA keys and other key formats.

After some internal research, I found that FastAPI is vulnerable to the same ReDoS under certain conditions (only when it parses Form data not JSON).\n\nHere are the details: I'm using the latest version of FastAPI (0.109.0) and the following code:\n\n```Python\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI,Form\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass Item(BaseModel):\n    username: str\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse)\nasync def index():\n    return HTMLResponse(\"Test\", status_code=200)\n\n@app.post(\"/submit/\")\nasync def submit(username: Annotated[str, Form()]):\n    return {\"username\": username}\n\n@app.post(\"/submit_json/\")\nasync def submit_json(item: Item):\n    return {\"username\": item.username}\n```\n\nI'm running the above with uvicorn with the following command:\n\n```console\nuvicorn server:app\n```\n\nThen run the following cUrl command:\n\n```\ncurl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8000/submit/'\n```\n\nYou'll see the server locks up, is unable to serve anymore requests and one CPU core is pegged to 100%\n\nYou can even start uvicorn with multiple workers with the --workers 4 argument and as long as you send (workers + 1) requests you'll completely DoS the FastApi server.\n\nIf you try submitting Json to the /submit_json endpoint with the malicious Content-Type header you'll see it isn't vulnerable. So this only affects FastAPI when it parses Form data.\n\nCheers\n\n#### Impact\n\nAn attacker is able to cause a DoS on a FastApi server via a malicious Content-Type header if it parses Form data.\n\n#### Occurrences\n\n[params.py L586](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/d74b3b25659b42233a669f032529880de8bd6c2d/fastapi/params.py#L586)\
