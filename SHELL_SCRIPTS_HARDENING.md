# Shell Scripts Hardening Summary

## Overview
All shell scripts in the Mobius project have been updated to include fail-fast behavior using `set -euo pipefail` at the beginning of each script. This ensures scripts exit immediately on errors and prevents silent failures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `set -euo pipefail` to all shell scripts

The following scripts were updated:
- `/frontend/run-tests.sh`
- `/scripts/backend/check-production-config.sh`
- `/scripts/pre-commit/check-env-files.sh`
- `/.claude/hooks/auto_format_code.sh`
- `/.claude/hooks/session_commit_detailed.sh`

**What each flag does:**
- `-e`: Exit immediately if any command exits with non-zero status
- `-u`: Treat unset variables as an error and exit immediately
- `-o pipefail`: Return value of a pipeline is the status of the last command to exit with non-zero status

### 2. Fixed test runner argument passing in frontend/run-tests.sh

**Problem:** The original script used `npm test` which doesn't properly pass arguments to the underlying test runner (Vitest).

**Solution:** Changed to use `npx vitest run` directly, which ensures proper argument passing and consistent behavior.

### 3. Added file existence checks in run-tests.sh

Added conditional checks to verify test files exist before attempting to run them, preventing the script from failing when specific test files are missing.

### 4. Fixed variable expansion in check-production-config.sh

Changed unprotected variable references like `$VARIABLE` to `${VARIABLE:-}` to prevent errors when variables are unset (compatible with `-u` flag).

### 5. Fixed grep commands that might fail

Added `|| true` or `2>/dev/null` to grep commands in session_commit_detailed.sh that might return non-zero exit codes when no matches are found.

## Script Status

### Already had fail-fast behavior:
- `/tests/test_dev_scripts.sh` - Already included `set -euo pipefail`

### Not modified (not shell scripts):
- `.git/hooks/commit-msg` - Simple hook that calls Python script
- Various `.md` files that contain shell examples but aren't executable scripts

## Benefits

1. **Early error detection**: Scripts will fail fast instead of continuing with partial success
2. **No silent failures**: Unset variables and failed commands will be caught immediately
3. **Better debugging**: Errors will be reported at the exact point of failure
4. **Consistent behavior**: All project scripts now follow the same error handling pattern
5. **Proper test execution**: Frontend tests now use the correct command syntax for Vitest

## Testing

You can verify the changes work by running:
```bash
cd frontend
./run-tests.sh
```

The script should now properly run tests and handle missing test files gracefully.
