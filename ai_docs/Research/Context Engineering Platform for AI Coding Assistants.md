# Comprehensive Plan: Context Engineering Platform for AI Coding Assistants

## Executive Summary

Context engineering represents the next evolution in AI coding assistance, moving beyond simple prompt engineering to sophisticated systems that dynamically orchestrate information, tools, and capabilities. This plan provides a detailed roadmap for building a production-ready platform that integrates with Claude Code, Cursor, and other coding assistants, with projected development costs of $1.6-2.2M over 24 months and a team of 8-12 specialists.

## 1. Technical Architecture

### Core System Design

The platform follows a **layered architecture** with these essential components:

**Context Orchestration Layer**
- Central controller managing context assembly and distribution
- Dynamic context selection based on task requirements (feature development, debugging, refactoring)
- Context budget management to optimize token usage
- Priority-based ranking with relevance scoring

**Multi-Tier Memory System**
- **Working Memory**: Current task context, active file contents, recent modifications
- **Session Memory**: Conversation history, user preferences, task accumulation
- **Long-term Memory**: Behavioral patterns, project conventions, architectural decisions
- **Implementation**: Hierarchical memory networks with automatic consolidation achieving 90% token reduction

**Context Processing Pipeline**
```
Input → Chunking → Semantic Analysis → Compression → Assembly → Delivery
         ↓           ↓                   ↓            ↓          ↓
      AST-based   Embeddings      LLMLingua     Dynamic      API/SDK
      Parsing     Generation      (5x reduction) Selection   Integration
```

### Advanced RAG Implementation

**Vector Database Architecture**
- **Primary**: Qdrant (626 QPS at 99.5% recall, $9/50k vectors)
- **Secondary**: Pinecone for enterprise deployments
- **Embeddings**: Code-specific transformer models with multi-language alignment
- **Retrieval**: Hybrid approach combining semantic search, symbol-based retrieval, and context-aware ranking

**Code-Specific Optimizations**
- Function-level chunking with AST boundaries
- Import and dependency-aware segmentation
- Real-time codebase indexing with incremental updates
- Multi-modal embeddings for code, comments, and documentation

### Multi-Agent Coordination System

**Agent Architecture Pattern**
```

└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┬────────┬────────┐
