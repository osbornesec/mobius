# Task 001: Development Environment Setup

## Overview
Set up the complete local development environment for the Mobius Context Engineering Platform, including all required tools, dependencies, and configurations.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All developers can run `docker-compose up` and have a working environment
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks are installed and functioning
- [ ] All required dependencies are documented and version-pinned
- [ ] Development environment starts in under 60 seconds
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured with examples

## Test First Approach

### Tests to Write BEFORE Implementation:

1. **Environment Validation Test** (`tests/test_environment_setup.py`):
```python
def test_required_tools_installed():
    """Verify all required development tools are available."""
    # Test Docker version >= 20.10
    # Test Docker Compose version >= 2.0
    # Test Python version == 3.11.x
    # Test Node.js version >= 18.0
    # Test PostgreSQL client tools
    # Test Redis client tools

def test_docker_compose_configuration():
    """Verify docker-compose.yml is valid and services are defined."""
    # Test docker-compose config is valid YAML
    # Test all required services are defined
    # Test port mappings don't conflict
    # Test volume mounts are correctly configured

def test_environment_variables():
    """Verify .env.example contains all required variables."""
    # Test all required env vars are documented
    # Test default values are provided where appropriate
    # Test sensitive values are not committed
```

2. **Development Scripts Test** (`tests/test_dev_scripts.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test setup script creates virtual environment
# Test setup script installs dependencies
# Test development server startup scripts work
# Test database initialization scripts work
```

## Implementation Details

1. **Create Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector extension
   - Redis 7.0
   - Python 3.11 base image for backend
   - Node.js 18 base image for frontend
   - Network configuration for service communication

2. **Python Environment Setup**:
   - Create `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
   - Configure `pyproject.toml` for project metadata
   - Set up `.python-version` for pyenv users
   - Configure virtual environment activation scripts

3. **Node.js Environment Setup**:
   - Initialize package.json with exact versions
   - Configure `.nvmrc` for Node version management
   - Set up npm scripts for common tasks

4. **Development Tools Configuration**:
   - Pre-commit hooks configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
   - EditorConfig for consistent formatting
   - VS Code workspace settings and recommended extensions
   - Git hooks for code quality checks

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create `.env.example` with all required variables
   - Document each variable's purpose and format
   - Set up `.env.local` for local overrides

## Dependencies
- None (this is the first task)

## Estimated Time
8-12 hours

## Required Skills
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python virtual environment management
- Node.js/npm ecosystem knowledge
- Basic DevOps and shell scripting
- Git and version control
