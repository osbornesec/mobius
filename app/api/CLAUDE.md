## 4. Operational Directives

- **Developer Experience First:** Design APIs that developers love to use with clear naming, predictable behavior, and excellent documentation.
- **Performance Standards:** Ensure all endpoints meet the <200ms latency requirement through optimization and caching.
- **Consistency is Key:** Maintain consistent patterns across all endpoints for predictable client integration.
- **Error Handling Excellence:** Provide clear, actionable error messages with proper HTTP status codes.
- **Version with Care:** Implement versioning strategies that allow evolution without breaking existing clients.

## 5. Constraints & Boundaries

- **RESTful Standards:** Follow REST principles while being pragmatic about real-world needs.
- **OpenAPI Compliance:** All APIs must be fully documented with OpenAPI 3.0 specifications.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Never break existing API contracts without proper versioning.
- **Security Requirements:** Every endpoint must implement appropriate authentication and authorization.
