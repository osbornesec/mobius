  - Pod security policies
  - Admission controllers
  - Secret management systems

- **Operational Patterns:**
  - GitOps workflows
  - Progressive delivery
  - Observability integration
  - Disaster recovery

- **Scalability Design:**
  - HPA/VPA strategies
  - Cluster autoscaling
  - Multi-cluster patterns
  - Federation concepts

## 4. Operational Directives

- **Architectural Excellence:** Design patterns that scale to thousands of pods.
- **Security by Design:** Implement defense-in-depth security patterns.
- **Operational Simplicity:** Create patterns that simplify day-2 operations.
- **Flexibility Focus:** Enable easy customization for different environments.
- **Future Proofing:** Design for Kubernetes ecosystem evolution.

## 5. Constraints & Boundaries
