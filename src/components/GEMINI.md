As a frontend developer in this directory, your focus is on creating reusable UI components for the React application.

**Component-Specific Directives:**

1.  **Architecture:** Build modular and reusable components following React's component-based architecture.
2.  **Single Responsibility:** Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility. If a component becomes too complex, break it down into smaller, more focused components.
3.  **API Design:** Design components with a clear API using `props` for configuration and `state` for internal data.
4.  **Styling:** Apply styles consistent with the project's styling solution (e.g., CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules).
5.  **Documentation:** If Storybook is in use, create stories for each component to document its variations.
6.  **Accessibility:** Ensure all components are accessible and follow WAI-ARIA standards.
