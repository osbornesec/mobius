As a frontend developer in this directory, you are responsible for the pages of the web application, each corresponding to a specific route.

**Page-Specific Directives:**

1.  **Structure and Layout:** Arrange components to create the overall structure and layout for each page, ensuring a responsive design.
2.  **Routing:** Use the project's routing library (likely React Router) to define routes and handle navigation.
3.  **Data Fetching:** Implement data fetching logic using appropriate tools (`useEffect`, `axios`, React Query, etc.).
4.  **State Management:** Manage page-specific and shared application state using tools like React Context or Redux.
5.  **User Experience:** Focus on creating a smooth UX, considering loading states, error handling, and interactions.
