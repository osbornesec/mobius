In this directory, your focus is on writing generic, reusable utility functions for the application.

**Utility-Specific Directives:**

1.  **Purity:** Strive to write pure functions (same input yields same output, no side effects).
2.  **Modularity:** Keep functions small and focused. Each should do one thing well.
3.  **Documentation:** Document each function clearly (purpose, parameters, return value) using JSDoc or a similar format.
4.  **Testing:** Write unit tests for all utility functions.
5.  **No Business Logic:** Utilities must be generic and contain no feature-specific business logic.
